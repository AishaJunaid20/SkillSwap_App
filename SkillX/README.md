# 🤝 SkillSwap Pakistan – Barter Skills. Build Communities.

**A Python OOP + Streamlit powered platform where Pakistanis can exchange skills without money. Learn. Teach. Grow together.**

---

## 🌟 What is SkillSwap Pakistan?

**SkillSwap Pakistan** is a digital barter platform that lets people **exchange skills** directly.  
No money. Just mutual growth.  
A graphic designer can learn English from a language tutor.  
A baker can learn coding from a CS student.  
A tailor can teach sewing to someone offering basic literacy classes.

It’s a **community-driven ecosystem** to promote:

- 🔄 Skill Exchange
- 👫 Local Collaboration
- 🚀 Self-Empowerment without cost barriers

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 👤 User Profiles with teach/learn skills
- 🔍 Intelligent matching system (OOP-based logic)
- ✍️ Skill Offer Listings
- 📨 Match Requests and Acceptance
- ✅ History of completed swaps
- 🛡️ Simulated admin panel to review interactions

## 👩‍💻 OOP Concepts Used

SkillSwap is built with **pure Python OOP** + Streamlit for the frontend. Here’s how:

| Class             | Role                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `User`            | Parent class for SkillSeekers and SkillProviders                     |
| `SkillOffer`      | Stores the skill a user can teach, availability, and requirements    |
| `SkillRequest`    | Represents a request to exchange a skill with another user           |
| `SwapEngine`      | Handles matchmaking logic and manages active/inactive swaps          |
| `Admin`           | Simulated review system to manage fake users or abuse reports        |
| `DatabaseSim`     | Simulates a local storage system for users and swaps                 |

**Why OOP?**  
Because real-world problems like barter systems involve **entities** (users, skills, swaps), **interactions**, and **rules** — which map perfectly to classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
